title: "SCS: Self-Contained Systems"
description: Self-contained Systems (SCS) is a software architecture focused on a separation into independent systems - similar to microservices
---

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Self-contained System (SCS) approach is an architecture that
focuses on a separation of the functionality into many independent
systems, making the complete logical system a collaboration of many
smaller software systems. This avoids the problem of large monoliths
that grow constantly and eventually become unmaintainable.
Over the past few years, we have seen its benefits in many mid-sized
and large-scale projects.</p>

<p>The idea is to break a large system apart into several smaller
self-contained systems, or SCSs, that follow certain rules.<p>

<h2 id="scs-characteristics">SCS Characteristics</h2>
<ol>

	<li id="autonomous">Each SCS is an <a href="#autonomous">autonomous web
	application</a>. For the SCS's domain, all data, the logic to process that data and
	all code to render the web interface is contained within the
	SCS. An SCS can fulfill its primary use cases on its own,
	without having to rely on other systems being available.</li>

	<li id="one-team">Each SCS is owned by <a href="#one-team">one team</a>. This
	does not necessarily mean that only one team can change the
	code, but the owning team has the final say on what goes
	into the code base, for example by merging pull-requests.</li>

	<li id="async">Communication with other SCSs or 3rd party
	systems is <a href="#async">asynchronous wherever possible</a>. Specifically,
	other SCSs or external systems should not be accessed synchronously
	within the SCS's own request/response cycle. This decouples the
	systems, reduces the effects of failure, and thus supports
	autonomy. The goal is decoupling concerning time: An SCS should
	work even if other SCSs are temporarily offline. This can be
	achieved even if the communication on the technical level is
	synchronous, e.g. by replicating data or buffering requests.</li>

	<li id="optional-api">An SCS can have an <a href="#optional-api">optional service
	API</a>. Because the SCS has its own web UI, it can
	interact with the user &mdash; without going through a UI
	service. However, an API for mobile clients or for other SCSs
	might still be useful.</li>

	<li id="data-and-logic">Each SCS must <a href="#data-and-logic">include data and
	logic</a>. To really implement any meaningful features both
	are needed. An SCS should implement features by itself and
	must therefore include both.</li>

	<li id="no-shared-ui">An SCS should make its features usable
	to end-users via its own UI. Therefore the SCS should have
	<a href="#no-shared-ui">no shared UI</a> with other SCSs. SCSs might still have
	links to each other. However, <a href="#no-sync">asynchronous
	integration</a> means that the SCS should still work even if
	the UI of another SCS is not available.
	</li>

	<li id="no-code-sharing">To avoid tight coupling an SCS should
	<a href="#no-code-sharing">share no business code</a> with other SCSs. It might be fine to
	create a pull-request for an SCS or use common libraries,
	e.g. database drivers or oAuth clients.</li>
	
	<li id="minimize-shared-infrastructure">To make SCSs more robust and improve
	decoupling <a href="#avoid-common-infrastructure">shared infrastructure can be minimized</a>.
	E.g. a shared database make fail safeness and scalability of the SCSs
	depend on the central database. However, due to e.g. costs a shared database with separate
	schemas or data models per SCS can be a valid alternative. </li>
</ol>
